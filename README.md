# IntroToSolidity

Solidity is a high-level programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It was developed specifically for Ethereum and is designed to be easy to learn and use for developers. Solidity is a statically typed language, which means that variables have to be declared with their type at compile-time.

Solidity allows developers to create custom smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. These smart contracts are then stored on the Ethereum blockchain and can be executed automatically when certain conditions are met.

Smart contracts written in Solidity can be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating tokens, managing digital assets, and implementing voting systems. Solidity is also used to write decentralized applications (dApps) that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
